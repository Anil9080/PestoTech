# Title: Automated Testing for an E-commerce Website

Description: In this take-home assignment, your goal is to design and implement an automated testing strategy to ensure the quality and functionality of the website. This assignment will help us assess your skills in test planning, test case design, and test automation.

# Part 1: Test Planning
The primary objectives of testing for the e-commerce website are as follows:

Ensure functionality: Verify that all features and functionalities of the website work as intended.
Usability: Evaluate the user interface and overall user experience to ensure it is intuitive and user-friendly.
Performance: Assess the website's responsiveness, speed, and scalability under different load conditions.
Security: Validate the security measures implemented to protect user data and transactions.
Compatibility: Confirm compatibility across various devices, browsers, and operating systems.
Reliability: Ensure the website is stable and available for users at all times.
Data Integrity: Verify the accuracy and integrity of data transactions and storage.
# 2. Scope of Testing:
The testing scope includes:

Functional Testing: Validate all functional aspects of the website, including user registration, product search, checkout process, and payment.
Usability Testing: Assess the user interface, navigation, and overall user experience.
Performance Testing: Evaluate the website's speed, responsiveness, and scalability.
Security Testing: Verify the security measures in place to protect user data and transactions.
Compatibility Testing: Confirm compatibility across different devices, browsers, and operating systems.
Regression Testing: Ensure new features or changes do not negatively impact existing functionalities.
# 3. Testing Levels:
Unit Testing: Validate individual components and functions.
Integration Testing: Verify the interaction and integration of different modules.

Exit Criteria: Successful completion of all test cases, minimal open critical defects, and approval from stakeholders.
# 6. Test Environment and Tools:
Test Environment: Multiple environments representing production, staging, and development.
Testing Tools: Selenium for automated functional testing, JMeter for performance testing, OWASP ZAP for security testing, and CrossBrowserTesting for compatibility testing.
# 7. Risk Analysis:
Technical Risks: Potential issues with third-party integrations.
Operational Risks: Server downtimes, data backup failures.
Security Risks: Data breaches, unauthorized access.
Business Risks: Poor user adoption, financial losses.
# 8. Test Schedule:
Test Planning: Week 1-2
Functional Testing: Week 3-4
Usability Testing: Week 5-6
Performance Testing: Week 7-8
Security Testing: Week 9-10
Compatibility Testing: Week 11-12
Regression Testing: Ongoing
